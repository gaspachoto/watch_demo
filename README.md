# watch_demo
Watch This is a demo app built using Django web framework. The application allows users to view movie suggestions added by the other users with rating and description of the movies. Every registered user can share their movie suggestions with a poster and description and rate and comment other users' movies. Users can also edit and delete their own movie suggestions, but they cannot rate their own movies. The app uses PostgreSQL for its database. There are five models - movie, actor, app_user, movie_comment and movie_rating. There is an admin panel with one superuser who has full CRUD access and two admins who can edit and delete movies and comments. There are more than ten pages who are only accessible by the registered user. On the home page users can only log in or register after which they will be redirected to the movie suggestion page with all the suggested movies who are ordered by date and are paginated.
